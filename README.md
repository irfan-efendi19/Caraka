## Background
Indonesia is a multicultural country that has 17.508 islands, 583 languages and 1.128 ethnics/tribe. One of the examples is traditional languages from our ancestors called Aksara. In spite of many types of Aksara In Indonesia, There are only a small fraction of people that can read or write it fluently. Therefore, we made this project called CARAKA, which stands for Cakap Beragam Aksara. Caraka is an android-based educational application that teaches users about Aksara from Lampung, Bali, and Sunda. 
We are really concerned about some Indonesian cultures that are starting to disappear. This is proven by the rare application of this traditional culture in Indonesia. For example, youngsters only know Aksara Jawa as the only one Aksara in Indonesia. Not only that, they are more likely to learn foreign languages than traditional languages of their own. It is the reason that we started thinking why people, especially young people, do not want to learn Aksara. Thus, we thought that maybe learning Aksara is boring and difficult. So, in order to preserve Indonesian culture, we will develop this fun-learning app, CARAKA, to encourage Indonesian citizens, especially The Beta Generation, to think that learning Aksara is way more fun than they think. Apart from that, by spreading the use of Aksara in daily life, we will encourage more citizens to start to learn Aksara and preserve it for the next generation
